# React Project (Built with Vite)
This is the side react js application which handles the video calling part for therapy sessions using VideoSDK.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository: `[git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git](https://github.com/PinkBud/webRTC.git)`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd webRTC`
3. Install the project dependencies: `npm install`

## Development Server

To start the development server, run: `npm run start`

This command will start the Vite development server and provide you with a local URL where you can view your React application (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`). The development server will automatically reload the page whenever you make changes to the source files.
